# Person_Machine_Website
A warm person-machine app, used to comfort myself only.

(I appreciate the idea of having a warm, empathetic platform to turn to when I'm feeling down. Sometimes, in difficult moments, I find it most comforting to hear genuine words of understanding from another person. However, I understand that creating such a personalized app could provide a convenient way for me to offer myself that same level of compassionate support. Having the ability to provide that caring perspective to myself, when I need it most, could be very valuable. I will certainly consider developing such an app as a way to better comfort and console myself during challenging times.)
